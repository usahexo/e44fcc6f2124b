#  James Bond drinks unique cocktails in Casino Royale

A study of the cocktails ordered by James Bond in the 2006 movie Casino Royale reveals some unique choices for the spy.

The Vesper is one of Bond's most famous cocktails, and it's made with vodka, gin, and Lillet Blanc. This drink is light and refreshing, perfect for enjoying on a hot day.

Another popular cocktail ordered by Bond is the Margarita. He seems to prefer his Margaritas on the rocks, with a dash of lime juice to give them a zesty flavor.

Casino Royale also features two interesting takes on the Martini. The first is a Dirty Martini, which is made with olive brine in addition to vermouth. The second is a Vesper Martini, which is basically a Vesper cocktail but with Martinis instead of vodka and gin.

Bond also enjoys a good old-fashioned Gin and Tonic in Casino Royale. This drink is always refreshing, especially on a hot day.

Overall, it's clear that James Bond has quite eclectic taste in cocktails! Whether he's enjoying a Dirty Martini or a Gin and Tonic, you can be sure that he's doing it with style.

#  James Bond's favourite drink is now available at Genesis Casino

Fans of the James Bond movie franchise will be pleased to hear that his favourite drink – the Vesper Martini – is now available at Genesis Casino. This cocktail is a mix of vodka, gin and Lillet Blanc, and has been enjoyed by Bond villains and heroes alike for many years.

Those who want to try out this classic drink can head to the casino's bar and ask for a Vesper Martini. The bartenders will know how to make it perfectly, and they can also provide some ideas for other cocktails that might suit your taste.

The Vesper Martini is named after Vesper Lynd, the Bond girl from the 1953 movie "Casino Royale". In the movie, she makes him a special drink called a Vesper Martini, which he then orders every time he visits a bar.

Interestingly, although Bond orders a Vesper Martini in almost every movie, he never actually drinks one on-screen. This could be because the filmmakers didn't want to show him drinking alcohol – or it could simply be because they didn't think it looked very exciting!

In any case, you can now enjoy this iconic drink at Genesis Casino. So why not head over there today and see what all the fuss is about?

#  casino royale James Bond drinks bourbon whiskey

The bourbon whiskey in Casino Royale is Maker's Mark, and it's one of the movie's signature drinks. In fact, when challenged to make a vodka martini "shaken, not stirred" in his very first appearance on-screen, Bond replies "Do I look like I drink martinis?"

Bond orders his bourbon on the rocks with a splash of water. He probably knows that this is the ideal way to drink Maker's Mark. The distillery recommends enjoying their whiskey neat or with a little ice water.

Why does Bond like Maker's Mark? It's a good question. There are plenty of other bourbons he could have chosen. But maybe he likes the taste of Maker's Mark, or maybe he appreciates that it's a Kentucky bourbon made according to traditional methods.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that Bond is a fan of Maker's Mark and bourbon whiskey in general. In fact, in Skyfall, he orders a Glenmorangie single malt whisky instead of his usual bourbon. But that doesn't mean he's given up on bourbon altogether - he still drinks it occasionally, as shown in Spectre when he has a glass of Wild Turkey neat while relaxing in his hotel room.
