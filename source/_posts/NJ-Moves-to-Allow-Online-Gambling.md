#  NJ Moves to Allow Online Gambling

After months of debate and a vote in the state Senate, New Jersey has moved closer to authorizing online gambling within its borders.

The bill, which was approved by a vote of 24-16, would allow Atlantic City casinos to offer casino games and poker to players in the state over the Internet.

“This is another tool to keep Atlantic City vibrant and strong,” said State Senator Raymond Lesniak, one of the leading sponsors of the bill.

Debate on the issue has been ongoing in Trenton since last year, when Governor Chris Christie first expressed his support for online gambling. The Christie administration estimates that online gambling could bring in as much as $1 billion in additional revenue for the state each year.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social ills, but supporters say that it will provide a new form of entertainment for residents and help shore up Atlantic City’s casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years.

The bill now moves to the Assembly for further consideration.

#  Delaware Allows Gambling for First Time in State History

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Delaware state senate allowed for gambling within state lines for the first time in history. The motion passed easily, with no one voting against it.

The bill allows for table games, such as roulette and blackjack, as well as slot machines at the state's three casinos. The casinos will also be able to offer sports betting, pending approval from the United States Supreme Court.

Governor John Carney is in support of the move and released a statement saying that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. "I applaud Senate leaders for their work on this important issue," said Carney. "This legislation will spur economic development and create good-paying jobs in our casino industry."

Opponents of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems, but supporters say that it is a way to bring in much-needed revenue. Delaware is facing a budget shortfall of $400 million this year, so anything that can help to close that gap is welcome news.

Delaware is not the only state considering gambling expansion; Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia are all looking into offering sports betting. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality of sports betting by late June.

#  Nevada Gaming Commission Allows Online Poker Rooms

The Nevada Gaming Commission announced on Wednesday that it will allow online poker rooms, which are expected to start operating in the state by the end of this year.

This is a major development for the online poker industry as Nevada is one of the most regulated and strict states when it comes to gambling. The fact that the commission has given the green light to online poker rooms shows that they believe these businesses can be run in a responsible and safe manner.

This news was cheered by the two major American poker players’ associations, Poker Players Alliance (PPA) and the Hendon Mob. PPA Chairman Jim Ryan issued a statement saying, “This is a great day for poker players in Nevada and around the world. We commend the commission for its thoughtful decision, which will allow Nevadans to play online poker in a safe and responsible manner. We look forward to working with the commission, operators and lawmakers to make online poker a reality in Nevada later this year.”

There are currently only three states – Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware – that have legalized online poker rooms. However, there are many other states that are considering doing so, including California, Illinois and Michigan. This recent development from the Nevada Gaming Commission should help to accelerate those efforts.

#  California Poised to Allow Online Gambling

The state of California is on the verge of legalizing online gambling. The proposed bill, Assembly Bill 2863, would allow for the legal regulation and taxation of online poker and other casino games. The aim of the legislation is to generate additional revenue for the state, while also providing a new form of entertainment for residents.

If passed, the bill would establish a Department of Internet Gaming within the California Gambling Control Commission. This department would be responsible for regulating all aspects of online gambling in the state, including licenses, taxes, and game rules.

Online poker has been illegal in California since 2006, when Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). This federal law prohibits financial institutions from processing payments to online gambling sites. As a result, most major US-based online poker companies have exited the market.

However, lawmakers in California have long been in favor of legalizing online poker. In fact, a similar bill was introduced in 2013 but failed to pass. This time around, there is more momentum behind the proposal, as lawmakers seek to address the state's ongoing budget crisis.

If passed, AB 2863 would generate an estimated $60 million in annual revenue for California. This money would be used to fund various government programs, including education and transportation improvements.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased problem gambling rates in California. However, proponents contend that such risks can be managed through strong regulations and consumer protections.

Regardless of whether or not AB 2863 is approved, it seems likely that online gambling will eventually be legalized in California. With so much money at stake, it's only a matter of time before lawmakers come to an agreement on a regulatory framework.

#  New York Considering Legislation to Allow Digital Gaming

The New York Gaming Commission is considering a bill that would allow operators to offer digital versions of games currently offered at land-based casinos in the state.

The proposed measure, Bill A10029A, was introduced by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow earlier this year and was recently reviewed by the commission. The bill would allow for the offering of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker, through internet-based platforms. Operators would be required to first obtain a license from the commission in order to offer the games.

Commission chairman Nick Sommer told reporters that the commission is still in the early stages of reviewing the bill and has not yet made any decisions about its potential implementation. He added that the commission will likely make a decision on the bill within the next few months.

Supporters of the measure argue that it could help to grow New York's gaming industry and bring in additional revenue to state coffers. However, opponents argue that it could create a new underground gambling market and lead to increased crime and social problems.
