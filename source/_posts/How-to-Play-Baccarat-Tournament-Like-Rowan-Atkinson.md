# 3: Know Your Limits

Another important thing to remember when playing baccarat is to know your limits. This means knowing how much money you’re willing to lose and sticking to it.

#  How to Master the Art of Playing Baccarat Tournament Like Rowan Atkinson

Scarcely known to the public is the fact that Rowan Atkinson, star of Mr. Bean and Blackadder, is an accomplished player of baccarat tournament. In this article, we shall reveal his secret techniques for gaining an edge at the table.

The first step is to familiarize yourself with the basic rules of the game. Baccarat is a card game played between two hands, the Player and the Banker. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 points with your two cards. Points are counted by taking the value of the digit in the right-most position (so an Ace counts as 1 point, 2 as 2 points, etc). If you go over 9 points with your two cards, then you count the left-most digit only (so 18 becomes 1 point).

The second step is to understand some of the more advanced concepts involved in baccarat tournament play. One such concept is 'bankroll management'. This simply means ensuring that you never bet more than you can afford to lose, and that you adjust your bets according to how well you are playing. For example, if you are losing money quickly then you should reduce your bets; conversely, if you are winning then you should increase them.

The third step is to learn when to take risks and when to hold back. This may sound counterintuitive, but it is actually very important in baccarat tournament play. For example, if you have a good hand then it might be worth risking everything on a single bet in order to win big; but if you have a bad hand then it might be better to fold and wait for a better opportunity.

The fourth step is to practice! It's no good trying out these techniques in a real baccarat tournament without any prior experience; instead, try playing some games online or at a casino first. This will help you get used to the flow of the game and give you a better idea of when it's safe to take risks.
