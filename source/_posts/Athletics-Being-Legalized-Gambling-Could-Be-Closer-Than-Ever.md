#  Athletics Being Legalized Gambling Could Be Closer Than Ever

Gambling on professional sports is a big business in the United States. In some states, it is perfectly legal to bet on games. In others, it’s not, but there are always people looking to place bets illegally. Congress has been discussing the possibility of legalizing gambling on sports for years, and it seems that they may be closer to a deal than ever before.

The potential legalization of sports betting has created a lot of discussion within the professional sports world. The NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL are all in favor of it, as they see it as a way to bring in more revenue. The NCAA, on the other hand, is opposed to it, as they believe that it would lead to more corruption in their sport.

So far, there have been two main proposals for how legalized gambling would work. The first is known as the “integrity fee”. This would be a payment that the leagues would receive from casinos in order to help pay for the costs of monitoring gambling on their games. The second proposal is known as “royalty fees”. This would be a percentage of each bet that would be paid to the leagues.

There are many pros and cons to legalized gambling on sports. On the pro side, proponents argue that it would bring in more revenue for the leagues and increase fan interest in the games. They also argue that it would create jobs and boost tourism. On the con side, opponents argue that it could lead to more corruption in college sports and increase addiction rates.

So far, there has been no consensus reached among lawmakers on how to move forward with legalized gambling on sports. However, with so much money at stake, it is likely that something will eventually get passed into law.

#  Athletics Betting Markets Continue To Expand Ahead Of Possible Legalization

The legalization of sports betting in the United States is inevitable at this point, as several states have either already launched regulated sports betting markets or have passed legislation that will allow for such activity. Of course, this means that the market for athletics betting is also expanding rapidly, with more and more bettors looking to stake their money on everything from professional baseball games to college basketball matchups.

There is certainly plenty of money to be made in athletics betting, but it can also be a quite volatile market, as upsets and unexpected results can dramatically shift the odds. With that said, there are a number of tips that can help you become a more successful athletics gambler. Here are some of the most important ones:

1. Do Your Research

One of the most important things you can do as an athletics gambler is to familiarize yourself with the teams and players involved in each matchup. This includes studying both the strengths and weaknesses of each side, as well as recent form and head-to-head records. In addition, be sure to take into account any injuries or other factors that could impact the outcome of the game.

2. Use Proven Strategies

There are a number of popular betting strategies that have been proven to be successful in the past. Some of these include using a points spread system when wagering on football or basketball games, or picking underdogs who are likely to win outright. It’s also a good idea to mix up your bets by making some straight-up wagers along with parlays and teasers.

3. Avoid Getting Emotionally Involved

It’s important to remember that athletics gambling is ultimately a business venture, so it’s crucial to stay objective at all times. This means avoiding making bets based on emotion (e.g., rooting for your favorite team) and instead making informed decisions based on sound judgement and analysis.

#  Illinois Poised To Lead The Way In Legalizing Athletics Gambling

In what might come as a surprise to some, the state of Illinois is poised to legalize sports gambling in the near future. And while there are certainly hurdles to overcome, it appears that lawmakers are serious about moving forward with the legislation. One of the driving forces behind this effort is Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who believes that legalized gambling can help to generate much-needed revenue for the state.

It’s worth noting that Illinois is not alone in its efforts to legalize sports gambling. In fact, a number of states have taken similar steps in recent years, including New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia. And while there has been some opposition to these efforts, it seems that the general consensus is that legalized gambling can be a positive thing for states and their residents.

So why is Illinois so keen on legalizing sports gambling? Well, as mentioned previously, one of the main reasons is that it could help to generate much-needed revenue for the state. Additionally, proponents of legalization argue that it will create jobs and spur economic growth. And given the fact that other states have seen success with legalized gambling, it’s likely that Illinois will too.

There are obviously some potential downsides to legalized gambling as well. For example, there is always a risk of addiction and financial instability. And if not properly regulated, gambling can lead to criminal activity and other negative outcomes.

But despite these risks, it appears that Illinois is ready to move forward with legalization. The state has already drafted legislation, and lawmakers are currently working on finalizing the details. It’s expected that a vote will take place later this year, and if all goes according to plan, sports gambling will be available in Illinois by early 2020.

#  New Hampshire Considering Athletics Gambling Bill

 The New Hampshire state legislature is currently considering a bill that would legalize sports gambling in the state. The proposed bill, HB 1292, was introduced on January 3 and has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.

If passed, the bill would allow for both in-person and online sports gambling. It would also establish a licensing system for gambling operators and require them to pay a tax on their profits. The tax rate would be set at 15 percent.

The bill has been met with criticism from some lawmakers, who argue that it could lead to increased addiction and social problems. However, supporters of the bill argue that it would bring new revenue to the state and create jobs.

A similar bill was introduced in New Hampshire last year but did not pass.

#  Michigan Weighing Athletics Gambling Bills

Michigan lawmakers introduced a trio of bills this week that would legalize sports gambling in the state.

The Michigan Gaming Control Board would be responsible for regulating the industry, which would include authorizing certain casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The board would also set the maximum amount players could bet and determine what types of bets could be placed.

The bills are Senate Bills 245-247. The first, SB 245, was introduced on Wednesday by state Sens. Curtis Hertel Jr., D-East Lansing, and Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge. It would allow casinos and racetracks to offer both in-person and online sports betting.

SB 246, introduced by state Sens. Doug Rumsey, R-Muskegon Heights, and Hertel on Thursday, would allow mobile sports betting only. And SB 247, introduced Friday by state Sens. Dave Robertson, R-Grand Blanc Township, and Wayne Schmidt, R-Traverse City, would allow both in-person and mobile betting but prohibit Betting on college athletic event which take place in Michigan.

The bills come as Michigan weighs whether or not to join other states in legalizing sports gambling in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year to strike down a federal ban on the practice.

According to a study from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming released in February, about $158 million was wagered on sporting events in Michigan in 2018 illegally – most of it through offshore websites. If legalized and regulated, that amount could grow to $424 million by 2023.

Opponents of legalized sports gambling argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social problems. But proponents say it would provide an additional source of revenue for the state while also creating jobs.

It's still unclear if or when the bills will come up for a vote in the Legislature, but they provide another indication of where Michigan is heading with regards to legalizing sports gambling.
