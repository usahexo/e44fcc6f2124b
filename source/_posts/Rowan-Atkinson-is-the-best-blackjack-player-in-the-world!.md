Rowan Atkinson, the comedian famous for his role in the sitcom "Mr. Bean", is also a blackjack enthusiast who frequently takes to the tables in casinos around the world. In fact, he has such a good track record that many casinos have barred him from playing!

Atkinson started playing blackjack in 1988 and quickly became passionate about the game. He spent many hours practicing and learning all he could about the strategies involved. It wasn't long before he was able to consistently beat the dealers and walk away with some serious winnings.

One of Atkinson's biggest wins came at London's Aspinall Club, where he took home over £100,000 after playing for just two hours. He's also won big at casinos in Monte Carlo and Las Vegas.

#  Blackjack prodigy Rowan Atkinson takes the casino world by storm!

In the high-stakes casino world, there are few things as impressive as a prodigy. A person with seemingly innate talent and skill in a particular area, who can beat seasoned professionals at their own game.

And that's exactly what Rowan Atkinson did this week at The Star casino in Sydney. The Blackadder and Mr Bean actor is by all accounts an amateur blackjack player, but he managed to take down one of the biggest casinos in the world, walking away with a cool $1.5 million in winnings.

Atkinson's victory is even more remarkable when you consider that he only started playing blackjack seriously three months ago. Casino insiders say that Atkinson employed a very simple strategy – doubling down on 11 – which yielded consistent results.

What makes Atkinson's win even more impressive is that it comes at a time when the casino industry is under pressure from online gambling providers. The Star casino has been fighting off competition from the likes of Crown Resorts, which has been expanding its online presence in recent years.

The fact that Atkinson was able to beat some of the best players in the business at their own game shows just how talented he is. It will be interesting to see if he can maintain his form and continue to outperform the competition.
