#  How To Win Big At Casino Blackjack - According to Rowan Atkinson

You've probably seen Blackjack played in casinos all over the world. It's a popular game for a reason - it's thrilling, and it has some of the best odds in the house.

If you're looking to up your game and increase your chances of winning big, read on. Rowan Atkinson, who is an expert on the game Blackjack, shares his tips on how to win big at casino blackjack.

1. Know The Rules

The first step to becoming a successful blackjack player is to learn the rules of the game inside out. This may seem like an obvious piece of advice, but many people choose not to bother learning the basics and this puts them at a disadvantage right from the start.

2. Stick To Basic Strategy

Once you know the rules of blackjack, it's important to stick to basic strategy. This means making statistically sound decisions based on the cards you are dealt. For example, if you have a hand with an Ace and a Ten value (known as a 'blackjack'), you should always stand rather than hit. Conversely, if you have low cards in your hand (such as 2 or 3), you should always hit in order to try and get closer to 21.

3. Minimize Your Losses

In any gambling game, it's important to remember that there will always be wins and losses. The key is to make sure that your losses are kept to a minimum, and this is something that can be achieved by using basic strategy correctly and by managing your bankroll wisely. Remember - it's better to walk away with some of your money intact than to lose it all in one go!

4. Don't Get Emotional

When playing blackjack in a casino setting, it's important not to let emotions get in the way of your decision making process. If you start getting angry or frustrated when things don't go your way, this can lead to bad decision making which will only result in you losing money faster. Casino games are meant to be enjoyed - so try and relax and enjoy yourself while playing!
