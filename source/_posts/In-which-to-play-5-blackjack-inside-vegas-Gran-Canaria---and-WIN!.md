#  In which to play 5 blackjack inside vegas Gran Canaria - and WIN!

Las Vegas can be a stunning town - but very costly. Going out to consume or drink is ridiculously high priced, so I made a decision to play blackjack in the Gran Canaria resort and enjoy some complimentary beverages!

I love blackjack and am pretty good at it. So I chose a table with a stakes of 5 euros ($5.50) - which is low adequate that if I did lose, it wouldn't genuinely matter. And to my utter amazement, inside about two hours I had won 160 euros! ($177).

If you're going to Las Vegas, or any other city where gambling is offered, then do not be afraid to try out your luck at blackjack - or any other game. Just make sure you set oneself limits, and do not get as well attached to any particular wager! Gambling must be enjoyable, not nerve-wracking. So go ahead and give it a try - who knows, you might just walk away a winner!
