#  Casino sweetens the pot with free parking!

It's the little things in life that can make all the difference, and the same holds true for casino gaming. Indeed, as any regular player knows, even a small perk or bonus can be the deciding factor when choosing one casino over another. In what could be seen as an effort to lure players away from its competitors, one casino has decided to sweeten the pot with free parking!

That's right - starting this week, players who visit the casino will be able to park for free. This is a great perk, as parking can often be quite expensive in major metropolitan areas. And, of course, it's just one more way for the casino to show its players that it appreciates them.

So if you're looking for a place to play some slots or table games, be sure to check out the casino that's offering free parking! You may just find that it's the perfect place for you.

#  Free parking adds to the appeal of So Sweet Game!

Free parking is a perk that shoppers in the So Sweet Game! district of downtown San Diego enjoy. Storeowners feel that it is one of the reasons why the district is thriving.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that, "the district's three-hour free parking has been a boon for retailers and restaurants, who say it has helped them to attract customers since its inception in November." The policy was enacted by city officials in an effort to revive the area which has seen better days.

According to Mike Clark, owner of the popular gastropub Urban Solace, "It's been great for business. It's brought people downtown that may not have come otherwise."

Downtown San Diego is home to a number of popular shopping destinations, including Horton Plaza, the Gaslamp Quarter, and Seaport Village. However, the So Sweet Game! district has been struggling in recent years as businesses have closed their doors.

Supporters of the free parking policy feel that it is helping to turn things around. Local business owners are reporting increased sales and foot traffic since the policy went into effect. In addition, new businesses are starting to open up in the district.

City officials say they are pleased with how things are going so far and they plan to continue offering free parking in the area for the foreseeable future.
