#  NJ Approves Legalized Gambling in Atlantic City 

The New Jersey state assembly has just approved a bill to legalize gambling in Atlantic City. The bill was proposed by the state governor, Chris Christie, and is now awaiting the signature of the state's acting governor, Richard Codey. This measure would allow up to 12 casinos in Atlantic City, as well as a statewide referendum on gambling.

Atlantic City has been struggling in recent years, with casinos closing and jobs being lost. The hope is that this new measure will revive the city's economy. Gambling is currently legal only in Nevada and Delaware, so this would make New Jersey the third state to offer it.

Governor Christie said of the bill: "This legislation is another critical step in our efforts to renew and reinvigorate Atlantic City and its casinos." Some opponents of the bill worry that it will lead to more addiction and social problems, but proponents argue that it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the state.

#  Atlantic City a Hot Spot for Legalized Gambling 

Atlantic City is one of the East Coast's most popular tourist destinations. People from all over the United States and the world visit Atlantic City for its many attractions, including top-notch restaurants, shopping, and of course - casinos!

Atlantic City has long been known as a hotspot for legalized gambling, but in recent years that reputation has taken a bit of a hit. In 2014, the New Jersey legislature passed a bill allowing online gambling within the state, but that move has done little to revive Atlantic City's gambling industry.

Despite the fact that Atlantic City's casino revenue continues to decline, there is still plenty of interest in legalized gambling here. In May 2016, voters in Atlantic City approved a referendum that would allow two new casinos to be built in the city. It will be interesting to see if this new development can help turn around Atlantic City's fortunes.

Whether you're a fan of legalized gambling or not, there's no doubt that Atlantic City is an interesting place to visit. With its rich history and abundance of attractions, it's easy to see why this city remains so popular today.
